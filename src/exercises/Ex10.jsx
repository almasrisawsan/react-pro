//This form has a few bugs. Click the button that increases the score a few times.
// Notice that it does not increase. Then edit the first name, and notice that the score has suddenly “caught up” with your changes.
// Finally, edit the last name, and notice that the score has disappeared completely.
// Your task is to fix all of these bugs. As you fix them, explain why each of them happens.
